''' task1 = Create a NumPy array called my_scores using np.array() with your last 5 Zomato 
order ratings (pick any integers between 1 and 5), and print the array.
'''

'''Task 2 =Use np.arange() to generate an array of all even numbers between 10 and 30 (inclusive),
 then print the result.
'''

'''Task 3 = Generate an array of 8 equally spaced values between 0 and 1 using np.linspace(),
and print the array.<br><br><em><strong>Hint:</strong> This is similar to how Spotify creates 
smooth volume sliders.</em>

'''Task 4 = Simulate a Flipkart-style 'Add to Cart' button counter by creating a NumPy array of 10
zeros using np.zeros(),then update the 3rd and 7th items to 1 (representing items added to cart),
and print the updated array.
'''

'''Task 5 = Use np.random.randint() to create an array of 6 random integers between 1000 and 9999
(representing random OTP codes like Paytm), and print the array.<br><br><em><strong>Constraint:
</strong> Set the random seed to 42 using np.random.seed(42) before generating the array so your
results are reproducible.</em>
